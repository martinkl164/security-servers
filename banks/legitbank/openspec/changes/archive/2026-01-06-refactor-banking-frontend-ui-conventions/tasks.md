## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add semantic design tokens in Tailwind config (e.g., `primary`, `neutral`) mapped to the existing palette
- [x] 1.2 Add reusable UI primitives via Tailwind `@layer components` (e.g., card, input, primary button)
- [x] 1.3 Refactor shared UI components to use semantic tokens/primitives without UX changes
- [x] 1.4 Refactor pages to use semantic tokens/primitives without UX changes
- [x] 1.5 Ensure tests are co-located with the `.tsx` files they validate (move any non-colocated tests)
- [x] 1.6 Run `npm test` and `npm run build` to verify behavior and production output
